## Advantages of using Flask

- Flask is a lightweight web application framework designed to get results fast and leave room to make the app more detailed in the future. 
- Due to its lightweight nature, the project's code always consists only of what you put in it, with no unnecessary code responsible for features you donâ€™t use.
